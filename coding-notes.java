9. implement strStr() ---> KMP algo.

The naive implementation of "needle" search in a "haystack" takes O(mn) time where m is length of needle and n is length of haystack.
KMP algo achieves the same result in O(m+n) time.

Algo: Keep comparing needle in haystack until there is a mismatch in character.
      As soon as there is a mismatch, look at the substring in needle before the mismatch char.
      In that substring, check if there is a suffix which is also a prefix.
      If one exists, then continue match from the character after the prefix in needle.
      Eg: haystack = "abcxabcdabxabcdabcdabcy", needle="abcdabcy"
      When first mismatch occurs at 4th character "x" and "d" of haystack and needle respectively,
      the substr in needle before the mismatch is "abc" which does not have a sufix which is also a prefix.
      So, continue with comparing first char("a") of needle with 4th char("x") of haystack.

      Next match is starting 5th char of haystack until 10th char i.e. "abcdab" with that of needle. Mismatch is at "x" and "c"
      The substr in needle before the mismatch is "abcdab" which has a sufix "ab" which is also a prefix.
      So, continue comparing 3rd character onwards of needle which is "c" with "x". Now no suffix in prefix in substring "ab".


To achieve this, we need to pre-process the needle.
Pre-processing algo: Eg: needle = "aabaabaaa"

    first element of output of preprocessing list is always 0.
    Start with j=0, i=1;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 0+1=1
        Increment both j and i.
    j=1, i=2;
        needle[j]!=needle[i] i.e. a!=b. So, j=output[j-1]=output[0]=0;
    j=0, i=2;
        needle[j]!=needle[i] i.e. a!=b, So,  output[i] = 0
        Increment i.
    j=0, i=3;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 0+1=1
        Increment both j and i.
    j=1, i=4;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 1+1=2
        Increment both j and i.
    j=2, i=5;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 2+1=3
        Increment both j and i.
    j=3, i=6;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 3+1=4
        Increment both j and i.
    j=4, i=7;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 4+1=5
        Increment both j and i.
    j=5, i=8;
        needle[j]!=needle[i]. i.e. b!=a. So j=output[j-1]=output[4]=2
    j=2, i=8;
        needle[j]!=needle[i]. i.e. b!=a. So j=output[j-1]=output[1]=1;
    j=1, i=8;
        needle[j]==needle[i]. So output[i] = output[j]+1 = 1+1=2

    Final output array = [0,1,0,1,2,3,4,5,2]

    Now use this output array to search needle in haystack.

78. All O(1) Data Structure:

Implement a data structure supporting the following operations:

    Inc(Key) - Inserts a new key with value 1. Or increments an existing key by 1. Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
    Dec(Key) - If Key value is 1, remove it from the data structure. Otherwise decrements an existing key by 1.
               If the key does not exist, this function does nothing. Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
    GetMaxKey() - Returns one of the keys with maximal value. If no element exists, return an empty string "".
    GetMinKey() - Returns one of the keys with minimal value. If no element exists, return an empty string "".

Challenge: Perform all these in O(1) time complexity.

87. Design a circular buffer of a given size. Design two of its interfaces:

    write(input, len) -> Attempts to write the input of length "len" to buffer. Returns the actual length of chars written.

    Eg: If buffer is of length 5.

    b = _ _ _ _ _

89. Find all possible interpretations of an array of digits

Consider a coding system for alphabets to integers where â€˜aâ€™ is represented as 1, â€˜bâ€™ as 2, .. â€˜zâ€™ as 26. Given an array of digits
(1 to 9) as input, write a function that prints all valid interpretations of input array.

Examples

Input: {1, 1}
Output: ("aa", "k")
[2 interpretations: aa(1, 1), k(11)]

Input: {1, 2, 1}
Output: ("aba", "au", "la")
[3 interpretations: aba(1,2,1), au(1,21), la(12,1)]

Input: {9, 1, 8}
Output: {"iah", "ir"}
[2 interpretations: iah(9,1,8), ir(9,18)]



Very nice explanation about visualizing the problem in the form of a tree.

============================================

Some more questions:
1. If there are objects(in a HashSet) whose hashCode is made up of all the attributes of that object. Suppose some attributes of an object
   changes after it has been inserted in the HashSet. What happens? Eg:

   class Person {
        String firstName;
        String lastName;
        Date DOB;
   }

Ans: Its hashCode is not recomputed automatically in Java. The setter method(used to change the attributes) needs to call the hashCode()
     method explicitly so that the new hashCode is recomputed and the updated object is rehashed into a different hash bucket.

     Followup: Is it possible to change an object without recomputing its hashCode(assuming that setter methods for each attribute calls
        hashCode() method to recalculate the hashcode.)
     Ans: Yes its possible. Eg:
            Person p1 = new Person(....);
            p1.DOB.setMonth("Feb"); // since this doesn't call the setter of Person class, hashcode is not recomputed.

    Followup: Is it possible to change one of the String type attributes and does hashcode of object change then?
    Ans: String is immutable data type. So, changing String attribute will not change the hashcode of the object.

    Followup: Is it possible to call a setter method to change an attribute of an object with its hashcode still being the original one?
    Ans: Yes. Call getter method before calling setter method. Modify getter method to return a copy of the original object.
         And then pass this copy to setter method to change the attribute. Thus the original object attribute remains the same
         and so does its hashcode.


2. Design a ticket system which contain Person type objects, where each Person has firstName, lastName and DOB.
    Functionalities to be supported are - insert(), delete() and findRandomPerson(). Perform these in the most optimal manner.

3. Given the root to a binary tree, design an algo to return the first seen local minimum in the tree. A local minimum is a node which
   is smaller than its parent node(if there is any) and both its children(if there are any).

   Discussion involved proving(by sorta mathematical induction) that a binary tree will always have a local minimum.

   Ans: Trivial solution - O(n) where n=no. of nodes in the tree. Iterate over all nodes to check local minimum.
        Improvement: Starting from the root, traverse down only on the path where the child node is smaller in value than the parent root node.


        Eg:     70
              /    \
            77      60
          /   \    /   \
         1    8    9    14
        / \  / \  / \   / \
       3   4 5 6  2 7  15 13

       Starting from 70, traverse through 60, 9 and 2. At every node, we are already guaranteed that it is smaller than its parent node.
       So, check whether it is smaller than its children or not. If yes, then we found our local minima.
       If not, continue traversing on the path which has the smaller/smallest child until we hit a leaf node.
       Eventually the leaf node(here 2) will be the local minima.

       Complexity: O(log n).


4. Given N sorted lists, design a solution to return a final sorted list containing all the numbers from the input list.

Ans: Use PriorityQueue to store k elements if there are k sorted lists in input. If there are a total of N elements in input, then
     time complexity of the solution is O(N logk)


5. Given a list of pointers as input where each pointer points to one of the nodes in a doubly linked list, return the no. of connected
   components. A connected component is a list of pointers which are pointing to nodes adjacent to each other. Note that a single node pointer
   pointing to a node which is not adjacent to any other node is still considered a connected component. Note that the doubly linked list
   can be almost a million nodes long.

   Ans: Similar to no. of friend circles given a group of friends and their friendships. Graph problem.

6. Given a list of Runnable tasks which take very less time to execute(~1msec) and a frequency after which each of those tasks need to be
   rescheduled, design a single threaded solution which takes these tasks as they become available to execute and executes them.

   Ans: Use a PriorityQueue<RunTask> to hold the tasks as they are added to the system. The comparator for PriorityQueue should place tasks
        in the increasing order of wait times i.e. frequencyMillis

   class RunTask {
        Runnable task;
        long frequencyMillis;
        long nextSchedTime;
   }


   public void schedule() {
        // adds task to the PriorityQueue
        // with next scheduled time = current time + frequencyMillis
   }

   public void run() {
        // dequeue a RunTask from queue
        // check if it is scheduled to run now
        // if yes, run it and call reschedule
        // if not, then add it back to end of priorityQueue w/o updating the nextSchedTime
   }


7. Design a garage system with the following specifications:

    Type of cars it can park:
        Minivan
        SUV
        Sedan

    Types of parking spots available:
        Compact
        Regular
        High Clearance


    There are a certain no. of spots available of each type. And the cars can fit in the following way:
        Minivan - can fit in all three types of spots
        SUV - can fit only in High Clearance spots
        Sedan - can fit in both High Clearance and Regular spots.

    Note that a valet guy knows the location of the parking spots, so we dont have to solve the geography problem of the garage.


    Public APIs expected out of the system are:
    1. Given a type of car, get an available parking spot ID so that the valet guy can park the car in that spot.
        Note that every spot has some form of String ID which need not be sequential.
    2. After the person is done using the garage, he shows the valet guy a ticket which contains his car ID. Given this car ID,
        determine the spot where this car is parked so that the valet guy can bring the car back.


    Improvements needed: Move the car to the most optimal spot(eg: a minivan should move to the compact location) if one becomes available
                         even after the car is parked.

A few more to think about:

++ Elevator design question - 50 floors, 4 elevators
++ Solve is-X-prime at high-scale
++ Given an array of integers, how would you remove all duplicates in linear time, i.e. O(n)?
    - Easy to do if its sorted array
    - Algo exists for O(n) if array of size>n contains numbers from [0,n] -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5414854/remove-duplicates-from-array-in-linear-time-and-without-extra-arrays
